## Hi ðŸ‘‹, 
I'm a Ph.D. candidate based in Amsterdam and member of the Database Architecture group at CWI. My research is focused on progressive indexing techniques, self-tuning tools, embedded database systems, and in-database analytics.

You can find a full list of my publications [here](www.pdet.github.io)

"The isolated man does not develop
any intellectual power. It is necessary for him to be immersed in an
environment of other men, whose
techniques he absorbs during the
first twenty years of his life. He may
then perhaps do a little research of
his own and make a very few discoveries which are passed on to other
men. From this point of view the
search for new techniques must be
regarded as carried out by the human community as a whole, rather
than by individuals."
